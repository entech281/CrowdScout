# CrowdScout

CrowdScout is (or will be) an FRC scouting application. But it's not just any other scouting application. 
The old method of scouting is that your team collects all the data it wants from all the matches it scouts,
and every other team at the compitition does likewise.

The innovation of CrowdScout is that instead of each team collecting the same data as every other team, all teams
in an FRC compitition contribute to the same data source. During each match, there will be three scouts from different 
teams watching the same robot, so that if an assigned scout makes a mistake, CrowdScout can know which the correct data.

So, if there are nine teams that sign up for CrowdScout for a competition, each team only has to scout 1/3 of the time. 
This approach gives better data, and gives your team more time to do what they love.
