# CrowdScout
It's not just any other scouting application. 

The old method of scouting is that your team collects all the data it wants from all the matches it scouts,
and every other team at the compitition does the same thing. Each team that scouts collects the same data as every other team.

  The innovation of CrowdScout is that all the teams sign up to contribute to the same data source, and at the end, they all recieve the data that everyone generated. This approach means less scouting and more data. CrowdScout will also have more than one scout watching a single robot during a match, so that even if one of the scouts misses something, CrowdScout will still have the correct data. Finally CrowdScout will collect more information in an easier format, so you can focus on the game, and not on filling out a form.

  So, if there are nine teams that sign up for CrowdScout at a competition, that's about 720 match records, merged into 240 detailed match profiles. There will also be an analysis on every team, and a pick list helper.
